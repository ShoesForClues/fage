# FAGE
Fun Arcade Game Engine for Love2D

FAGE is a 3D game engine that is built on top of the Love2D framework. It is written entirely in Lua with no FFI and all of the shader code is OpenGLES 3.0 compatible. The engine currently supports Wavefront (.obj) and COLLADA (.dae) files including multitextured meshes, armature rigging and animations. This project is still in WIP but new features are being added weekly.
